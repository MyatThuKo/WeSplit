<h1> 100 Days of SwiftUI Project 1 - WeSplit </h1> 
<p> WeSplit, a simple check splitting app built by using SwiftUI, such as NavigationView, Form, Section, Picker, and @State. 
This app allows you to calculate how much it will cost per person for a meal or dinner. </p>
<h2> Challenges to complete after the initial project </h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person” </li>
<li> Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people. </li>
<li> Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type. </li>
</ol>

<p> Created an app icon by using https://appicon.co/ and https://www.canva.com/ <p>
